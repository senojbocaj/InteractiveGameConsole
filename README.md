### Interactive Game Console Description

These files display the entire process for creating an interactive game console that is solely functional from the IDE's terminal. 
The game console is composed of three game: MyWordle, Rock Paper Scissors (vs. AI or another player), and a Trivia Game. 
There is a main menu that is accessible throughout the entirety of the gameplay cycle. This was completed during my fall semester freshman year (fall 2022).
